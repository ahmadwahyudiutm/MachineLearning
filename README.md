# Ahmad Wahyudi

These are some basic machine learning algorithms I implemented for school homework or for experiment.  
 Hope this can help beginners who are interested in R/Python programming and ML.  
 Note: All code are NOT optimized!

Current Models:

* Colaborative Filtering \(R\)
* Matrix Factorization \(java\)
* linear regression \(python\)
* logistic regression \(python, R\)
* Naive Bayes \(python\)
* Add SVM with SMO method \(pyhton\)
* Gaussian mixture model \(python, PyMC\)

TODO:

* kernel for SVM
* GLMNET for linear
